# Board Game Suggestor
A simple app that suggests a boardgame based on search parameters, and checks it against a JSON file containing a small list of games.

Plans for the next iteration include:
* Using the BGG XMLAPI, search the Board Game Geek website with user params
* Add results to collection
* addo more search params
